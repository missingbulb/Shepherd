//              re-queue or abandon, does the half-done work stand, was the
//              ceiling violation acceptable.
//   approval — the run SUCCEEDED and deliberately left an unmerged PR. The only
//              park that is not a fault; the human merges it or closes it.

//              forged item. Someone diagnoses and fixes code.
