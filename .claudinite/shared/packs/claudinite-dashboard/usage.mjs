// The PAST-DATA plane: one file per repo, read once per head sha.
//
// Everything else this page shows is a live read — what is open right now, what ran in
// the last few dozen runs — and live reads are the one thing a browser dashboard
// cannot afford to make deep. Reaching a month back over the API would be a paginated
// crawl per repo, per load, against the viewer's own rate limit.
//
// So the depth comes from a file the repo already folds for itself:
// `.claudinite/local/usage.GENERATED.json`, written hourly by claudinite-growth's
// usage-fold task. It is content at a sha, so it is cached like every other content
// read here — ZERO requests while the default branch has not moved — and one read
// answers every panel that looks further back than the live window.
//
// NOTHING HERE IMPORTS THE FOLD. The two packs are independent, and the file is
// self-describing precisely so a reader never has to: it carries a `fields` header
// naming the vocabulary each of its positional tuples is spelled in, and the decode
// below expands against THAT rather than against any list of its own. A field added or
// retired on the writing side reads correctly here with no change and no coordinated
// release; a version this code has never seen decodes as far as its own header goes.
//
// UNKNOWN IS NOT ZERO, all the way through. The fold leaves no key where a source
// could not answer — a day before a shallow checkout's history begins, a transcript
// shape carrying no token usage — and every series here carries that through as
// `null`. A chart breaks its line over a null; it never draws it at the floor.
