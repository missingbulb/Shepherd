// Every other panel on both pages REPORTS. A reader who opens the page already knowing
// what they came for is served by that; a reader who opens it because it is morning is
// not, because a wall of accurate panels asks them to do the ranking. This module does
// the ranking and names ONE piece of work.
//
// It invents no judgement of its own. A candidate is the worst thing some other module
// already decided is wrong — an item's `troubles` (the queue's real recovery rules) or a
// member summary's `reasons` — so the block at the top of the page can never disagree
// with the row further down that says the same thing.
//
// TWO SHAPES, AND THE ITEM ONE WINS TIES. An item candidate names an issue: it is a
// link a reader can act through. A repo candidate — a failing scheduler, a mount behind
// canon — has no issue behind it and is the fallback, because "go look at this repo" is
// a weaker prod than "open this issue".
