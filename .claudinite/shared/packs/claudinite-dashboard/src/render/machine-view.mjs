// The machinery panel, drawn. One renderer for both pages: the repo page draws it for
// one member and the fleet page draws the roll-up, and they are the same shapes — which
// is why this is its own module rather than two copies that drift.
//
// WHAT IT DRAWS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO.
//
// Every figure is a WINDOW AGAINST THE WINDOW BEFORE IT, because a cumulative total is
// a number a person reads as a report card and nothing measures. `windowFigure` is the
// page's own primitive for that and spells the previous figure out beside the arrow.
//
// A MISSING KEY IS *NOT RECORDED*. The derivation already answers null for a counter no
// day had an opinion on; `fmt` below renders that as an em dash and the note beside the
// tile says which source did not answer. Nothing here coerces a null to zero, and the
// one place a zero appears is where the window WAS folded and the word did not occur.
//
// ONE SCALE PER CHART. Two measures of different magnitudes get two charts, never two
// y-axes on one — so runs and closes are drawn separately rather than superimposed.
//
// PARKS AND LATENCIES ARE TABLES, not charts. The park kinds carry severity, and the
// page's status palette is reserved for severity; painting four park kinds as four
// categorical series would spend it on identity. A ruled table says the same thing and
// is also the table view the contrast rule obliges for the lighter series colours.
