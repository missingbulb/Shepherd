// The member's FLAT declarations: every declared pack's task.json and dashboard.json,

// read per task and a read per contributing pack, and like every content read it is
// cached under the sha, so a warm load spends nothing on it.
//
// A member whose converge predates the flat directory has neither file; each reader
// here answers null for it and the caller falls back to reading the sources one by
// one. Whether the file is there comes from the tree listing the caller already holds,
// so that answer costs no request.
//
// Spelled here, not imported: the page renders other repos in the viewer's browser and
// imports nothing from the engine. `flat-paths-drift.test.mjs` holds the copies to it.
