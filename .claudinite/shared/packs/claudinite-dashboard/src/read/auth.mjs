// How the page gets a credential: signing in, and nothing else.
//
// WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE, because it is the first thing anyone asks for: a static
// page CANNOT reuse the viewer's existing github.com login. Session cookies belong
// to github.com and are not sent to api.github.com, and the API does not accept
// cookie auth cross-origin under any circumstances. "Already logged in" is not a
// credential a browser can spend, so there is no configuration that avoids an
// explicit sign-in of some kind.
//
// What IS possible is making that sign-in a BUTTON rather than a paste box: the
// viewer clicks Sign in, GitHub asks them to authorize (once), and everything after
// runs as them, with exactly the repos and permissions their account already has.
// That is the honest version of "the current user's logged-in permissions", and it
// is the only route in — a paste box asks a viewer to go and mint a PAT, which is
// worse than the thing this replaced, and it was what every deployment offered
// until its owner configured the pair below.
//
// The one piece that cannot live here: exchanging the returned `code` for a token
// needs the app's client secret, and GitHub's token endpoint sends no CORS headers,
// so a browser cannot make that call even if the secret were public. It therefore
// happens at a configured `exchangeUrl` — a few lines of serverless function whose
// only job is that swap. It never sees repo data: once the token is back, the page
// talks to GitHub directly.
//
// A deployment that has not configured the pair cannot sign anybody in, and the gate
// says so rather than offering a worse credential (`app.mjs`, `renderGate`).

// WHERE THE CREDENTIAL LIVES IS THE VIEWER'S CALL, asked as `Remember me` beside the
// sign-in it applies to. Unremembered it goes to sessionStorage and dies with the
// tab; remembered it goes to localStorage and survives a browser restart, which is
// what stops a daily visitor from re-signing in every morning. The page cannot know
// whether the machine is shared, so it does not decide on the viewer's behalf — it
// defaults to the safe store and offers the other one in a control that is visible
// whichever way it is set.
//
// Nothing here bounds a remembered token's life. A GitHub App user token expires on
// GitHub's own schedule and comes back 401, which `signOut`s it. localStorage is the
// durable half of a credential whose lifetime GitHub owns, not a second lifetime this
