// How much of the viewer's GitHub rate limit this page is allowed to spend, and what
// it does instead when it cannot afford a live read. Pure: no clock of its own, no
// I/O, no DOM — `github.mjs` enforces what this decides.
//
// WHY A POLICY AT ALL, when `cache.mjs` already caches everything. Because the two
// credentials this page runs under differ by a factor of eighty-three:
//
//   unauthenticated   60 requests/hour, per IP address
//   a user token   5,000 requests/hour, per user (shared across every app they use)
//
// A fleet sweep costs roughly seven requests per member on a cold cache. Twelve
// members is ~84 — over the anonymous budget for the whole hour on the FIRST load, and the
// page then spends the rest of that hour rendering "unreadable" rows for repos that
// are perfectly fine. Caching alone does not save it, because the existing strategies
// all still make a request: an ETag revalidation is free of the PRIMARY limit but it
// is still a request, and a cold entry has nothing to revalidate.
//
// So the policy adds the one thing the cache layer cannot decide on its own: a
// STALENESS FLOOR. Under pressure, an entry younger than `minAge` is served without
// asking GitHub at all — no request, not even a conditional one. That is what makes
// "reload the page and it costs nothing for the next X minutes" true rather than
// merely cheap.
//
// The ladder is driven by HEADROOM — the remaining budget measured in whole page
// loads, not in requests — because "1,400 left" means something different to a
// one-repo page than to a forty-member fleet.

// Requests one member costs on a cold cache: repo metadata, head sha, the
// declaration, the tree, the live open listing, one history page of issues, one runs
// page, and a year of commit activity for the row's graph. A warm member costs fewer and a not-adopted one costs
// three, so this is the ceiling rather than the average — budgeting against the
// ceiling is what keeps the last member on the list readable.
