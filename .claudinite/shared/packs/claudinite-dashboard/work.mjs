// One table, three questions. Pure: no clock of its own, no I/O, no DOM.
//
// The repo page used to carry two tables — every declared task in one, every open work
// item in the other — and they were the same rows twice. A task's row could not say
// what its item was doing without repeating the item table, and an item's row could not
// say what it was FOR without repeating the roster. Worse, the reader had to join them
// by eye to answer the only question they open this page with: is anything stuck.
//
// So there is one row per piece of work, and the view decides which rows and which
// columns:
//
//   STUCK   — something has stopped. A park, a blown leash, an item off the state
//             machine, a task whose lane is held. This is the list to act on.
//   PENDING — work in flight or queued: an item exists and is moving.
//   ALL     — every declared task, including the ones that have never run, which is
//             the case a list built from items alone would silently omit.
//
// The classification is one function so the three views cannot disagree about what
// "stuck" means, and the ordering is severity-first so the top of any view is the worst
// thing true of this repo.
