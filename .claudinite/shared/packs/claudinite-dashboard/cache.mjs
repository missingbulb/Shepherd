// The client-side cache. Browser-only, and the reason a fleet-wide dashboard is
// affordable at all: without it, one page load across a dozen members spends
// several hundred API calls of a 5,000/hour budget, and a second look a minute
// later spends them again.
//
// THREE STRATEGIES, because the data has three different shapes and one TTL over
// all of them would be wrong in both directions:
//
//   IMMUTABLE  — repo content at a commit sha. A path at a sha cannot change, so
//                this is cached under the sha and never revalidated. The task
//                declarations are the whole win here: unchanged `main` means zero
//                calls to re-read every task.mjs.
//   VALIDATED  — anything live (open items, runs). Cached WITH its ETag and
//                re-requested with `If-None-Match`. GitHub answers 304 when
//                nothing changed, and a 304 does not count against the rate limit,
//                so this is free freshness rather than stale data.
//   AGEING     — closed history, which is settled but not addressable by a sha.
//                Plain TTL, 24h by default.
//
// Storage is `localStorage`, holding COMPACT PROJECTIONS rather than API payloads:
// a fleet's raw issue JSON is tens of megabytes and the quota is ~5, so what goes
// in is only the fields the model reads back out.

// The queue's published surface, the one place a cross-pack import is sanctioned: the
// projection below has to find a PR's closing issue by the same rule the fold does.
