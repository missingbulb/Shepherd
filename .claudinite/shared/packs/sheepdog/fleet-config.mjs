// The sheepdog pack's fleet CONFIG reader — the one parser for the enforcer repo's
// `sheepdog` pack entry.
//
// It lives at the pack root, not inside a task, because EVERY sweep reads the same
// entry: the roster sweep (tasks/fleet-roster/) needs `owner` and `exclude` for its
// coverage half plus `canonRepo` for its freshness half, and the
// pack-seed sweep (tasks/fleet-pack-seeds/) those plus `packSeeds`. A
// second reader would be a second place for the owner/exclude semantics to drift —
// and this is what the file-placement skill calls lifting a shared dependency to the
// nearest common ancestor: distance 2 from each task instead of one task reaching
// into the other's folder.

// The sheepdog repo's .claudinite-checks.json carries, on its sheepdog pack entry:
//   { "id": "sheepdog", "config": { owner: "missingbulb", kind: "user", exclude: ["owner/repo", ...],
//                                   canonRepo: "missingbulb/Claudinite",
//                                   packSeeds: [{ id: "<a pack>", config: { ... } }] } }
// owner is who to cover (default: the sheepdog repo's own owner); exclude is the repos
// deliberately kept out (a full owner/name each, lowercased). canonRepo is the
// freshness sweep's one knob and packSeeds the pack-seed sweep's one, and both
// default, so an existing config keeps working untouched. Callers read the
// home repo's file raw (fetched over the API, no
// engine on hand), so this resolves the entry itself — legacy top-level
// packConfig.sheepdog stays readable underneath until the `pack-entry-config` baseline
// migration retires (drop the fallback then). A missing config is an unreadable
// config: throw — absence is not consent to cover everything.
