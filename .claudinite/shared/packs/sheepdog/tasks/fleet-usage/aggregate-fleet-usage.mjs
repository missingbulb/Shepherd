// The sheepdog pack's fleet-USAGE sweep — the third cross-repo reach the pack adds,
// alongside the coverage census and the freshness sweep. Run by this pack's
// `fleet-usage` scheduled task (tasks/fleet-usage/), whose worker calls `main()`
// below as the task's `prework`, Action-side inside the enforcer repo's
// scheduler workflow where FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN is reachable. Still runnable by hand
// (`node aggregate-fleet-usage.mjs`) via the CLI guard at the foot.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Each member folds ITS OWN skill-usage aggregate (the
// grow_with_claudinite pack's usage-fold task). A member can therefore answer "does
// this skill ever load HERE" — and cannot answer the question the promotion ladder
// actually asks, which is whether a skill earns its place ACROSS THE FLEET. A skill
// that never loads in one repo may simply not be that repo's subject; a skill that
// never loads in any of them is mis-described or should not be gated at all. Only
// something looking at every member at once can tell those apart, and looking at
// every member is the sheepdog's whole job.
//
// STATELESS FULL RECOMPUTE. Read each member's usage file at its default branch and
// rebuild the fleet file as a pure function of those inputs. Idempotent by
// definition, and it self-heals any past error — at this cardinality (repos ×
// skills × weeks, all small) there is nothing to optimize away.
//
// COVERAGE IS EXPLICIT — over the WHOLE fleet, not just the members. A member with
// no usage file (not folding yet) or an unreadable one is LISTED as absent,
// census-style, never silently skipped. A denominator with an invisible hole in it
// is worse than no denominator. A member that declares itself DORMANT is out of the
// denominator entirely — and listed under its own heading, because "not in the
// race" and "should be folding and isn't" are different facts and only one of them
// is a problem. Uncovered and out-of-scope (archived/fork/excluded) repos are named
// too, contributing to no number: the coverage section accounts for every repo
// under the owner, so no state can drop a repo out of the report.
//
// The canon knows mechanisms, never repos: no member is named anywhere here. The
// member set is enumerated at runtime from the enforcer's own sheepdog config,
// exactly as the census and the freshness sweep enumerate it.
//
// Dependency-free (global fetch, Node 20+); read-only toward every member — the only
// thing it writes is the enforcer repo's own aggregate, and that is delivered by the
// worker, not here.
//
// It lives IN its task's folder because nothing else uses it. What IS shared with
// the other two sweeps sits at the pack root: the cross-repo REST primitives
// (fleet-api.mjs) and the config reader (fleet-config.mjs).
