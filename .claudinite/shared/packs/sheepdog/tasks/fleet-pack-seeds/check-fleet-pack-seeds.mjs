// The sheepdog pack's fleet PACK-SEED sweep — the enforcer making sure every member
// declares the packs this fleet has decided its repos should run, with the parameters
// only the fleet knows. Run by this pack's `fleet-pack-seeds` scheduled task, whose
// worker calls `main()` below as the task's `prework`, Action-side inside the enforcer
// repo's scheduler workflow where FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN is reachable. Still runnable by
// hand (`node check-fleet-pack-seeds.mjs`) via the CLI guard at the foot.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Some packs need a parameter no member can derive, because the answer
// is a fact about the FLEET rather than about that repo — where its people's files
// live, which repo holds something shared, what the group calls itself. Canon cannot
// supply it: a bootstrap run does not know which fleet it is bootstrapping into, and
// one fleet's value hardcoded in shared code is exactly the coupling packs exist to
// prevent. The enforcer can: it IS the fleet. So this repo's own config lists what its
// members should declare, and this sweep converges that list across them.
//
// IT KNOWS NO PACK BY NAME. Every id and every config below comes from `packSeeds` on
// this repo's sheepdog entry (fleet-config.mjs). That is the whole point: the enforcer
// contributes the MECHANISM — "these declarations, in every member" — and the fleet
// that declares this pack supplies the content. A sweep that named a pack would make
// the enforcer a second place packs are known, and the next fleet would inherit a
// choice that was never theirs.
//
// IT WRITES — the one sweep in this pack that does. The others report a condition and
// converge an issue for a human; a seed carries no human decision (the fleet already
// made it, in this repo's config), so an issue asking someone to copy it into every
// member would be ceremony around a mechanical edit. The write is one PUT to the
// member's default branch, guarded by the blob sha the read returned. It is not a
// content migration and does not ride the maintenance-branch lane baselining
// delivers on: there is no code in it, nothing to review, and it is
// idempotent — a member already declaring the seed is read and left alone. It does
// REFORMAT the declaration it edits to canonical 2-space JSON (the shape `--init`
// writes), because it round-trips the file through JSON rather than text-editing
// settings.
//
// THE MOUNT GATE. A declared pack whose code is not in the member's mount is a blocking
// `config` error there ("declares unknown pack"), and a member's mount carries only what
// that member declared as of its last converge. So a seed is written only where the
// pack's code is already ON DISK — for a pack arriving with canon, that is what the
// baseline migration arranges (it declares and re-converges in one transactional
// commit). `not-vendored` is a WAIT, not a finding: members converge nightly, and each
// is written the first run after its own mount carries the pack.
//
// SEED, NEVER OVERRIDE. A member that already declares the pack keeps its entry, and
// one that already carries a config for it keeps that config: both are that repo's
// decisions, and the fleet's list is a floor, not a ceiling. The same contract the
// `declarePacks` migration op keeps, for the same reason.
//
// A DORMANT member is never written to, like everywhere else in this pack: it declared
// itself out of the recurring work, and a commit landed from outside is exactly the
// upkeep it opted out of.
//
// Dependency-free (global fetch, Node 20+). Reads every member; writes declarations to
// the members that need them, and nothing else anywhere.
//
// It lives IN its task's folder because nothing else uses it — only this task's
// worker.mjs imports it. What IS shared with the other sweeps sits at the pack root:
// the cross-repo REST primitives (fleet-api.mjs) and the config reader
// (fleet-config.mjs).
