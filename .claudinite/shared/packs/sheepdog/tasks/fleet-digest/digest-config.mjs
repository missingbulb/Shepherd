// It deliberately does NOT re-parse what fleet-config.mjs already owns (owner,
// exclude, canonRepo, staleDays, packSeeds). The digest reads those through that
// module; this one covers only the block that is the digest's alone, which is why it
// lives in the task folder rather than beside fleet-config.mjs:
//
//   { "id": "sheepdog", "config": { "digest": {
//       "pick":  4,                       // how many accomplishments the brief names
//       "nudge": { "enabled": true, "quietDays": 7 }
//   } } }
//
// TWO KEYS, AND NOTHING ABOUT DELIVERY. The task finishes at a written report; an
// ad-hoc session reads that file out later in the day and its own notification
// mechanism carries it. So there is no recipient, no sender and no transport to
// configure here — a knob for any of them would describe machinery this repo does
// not own.
//
// Both keys default, and an absent `digest` block is a valid one — a fleet that
// configures nothing still gets its dated file. That is the same stance fleet-config
// takes on its own optional knobs, and it is what lets this pack keep being adopted
// without an interview, and every existing enforcer config keep working untouched.

// How many accomplishments the brief names. Four is the number the hand-run routine
// this task replaced settled on: enough that a busy day is represented, few enough
// that the brief stays skimmable.
