# Fleet: get every member declaring the packs it is missing

**This task runs no agent.** It is `agent_model: none` with a parameterised `prework` ([`worker.mjs`](worker.mjs)), so the whole pass is deterministic code the scheduler runs as a subprocess. This file is the human-facing record of what that code does; there is no dispatch issue and no enforcer-side subagent. The *agentic* half of the job belongs to each member's own **adopt-requested-packs** task (grow_with_claudinite) — see "The fan-out model" below.

## Two first stages, one parameter set

The task is parameterised over the two ways a pack comes to be missing ([`params.mjs`](params.mjs) — no parameter has a default; both call sites say everything):

| run | parameters | first stage |
|---|---|---|
| weekly (scheduled) | `--scan-for-needed-packs=true --repos=all-covered-members`, on the `prework` line in [`task.mjs`](task.mjs) | the **scan** ([`scan-for-needed-packs.mjs`](scan-for-needed-packs.mjs)): fingerprint every covered member's tree against the canon corpus and *suspect* what its declaration does not carry |
| forced (hand-started) | the scheduler's override bag: `FORCE_TASKS=fleet-add-missing-packs`, `SCAN_FOR_NEEDED_PACKS=false`, `REPOS=Alpha Beta`, `ADD_PACKS=<ids>`, `PACK_CONFIG=<pack>.<key>=<v>`, `PACK_ANSWER=<pack>.<question>=<answer>` (values space-separated — the bag splits on commas) | the **force** ([`force-add-packs.mjs`](force-add-packs.mjs)): the owner names the packs, repos, config and interview answers — nothing is suspected, because it was decided |

A force **refuses itself entirely** — before any issue is written — on an unknown pack id, a repo that is not a covered member or is dormant, `all-covered-members` as a target, or **any adoption-interview question the overrides did not answer**: an answer is the owner's to give, never one this task may infer.

## The fan-out model

Both stages end the same way, per member with work ([`protocol.mjs`](protocol.mjs)):

1. **Converge one work-list issue in that member** under the `add-packs` label — `Add packs: requested for this repo` (a decision, carrying the exact declaration entries as JSON, config and answers included) or `Add packs: suspected from this repo’s shape` (a suspicion, carrying the evidence and the fingerprints the REST sweep could not decide).
2. **Fire that member's own scheduler** with `FORCE_TASKS=adopt-requested-packs`. A forced run evaluates only that task (engine contract, #749).

The member's task reads its own issue, its own executor confirms/adopts with the repo checked out, and one reviewed PR lands *there*. The enforcer **dispatches**; the member **executes**. Nothing here writes to any member's tree, and no agent anywhere needs cross-repo access — the one fleet credential is `FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN` (Contents read, Issues read/write, Actions read+write).

## Convergence

- A **requested** issue closes `completed` once the member's declaration carries everything its JSON block asks for — checked on every weekly visit, whichever run opened it.
- A **suspected** issue closes `completed` once the member declares the packs (or its shape stops suggesting them), and a `not planned` close is a standing decline the scan honours rather than re-suggesting weekly.
- A member with a still-open work list is **re-fired** on the weekly visit — the retry loop for a member whose earlier adoption run died.

## Failure is loud

A member that could not be swept is `unknown` — never "fitted" — and a member whose scheduler refused the dispatch (missing workflow, PAT without Actions write, workflow disabled) is a work list nobody will act on. Both are named in the summary and fail the run; the scheduler converges a `needs-human` issue for the task family.
