// The enforcer states a seeded pack's config TWICE, for two different audiences, in one
// file:
//
//   - on its OWN entry for that pack — what a session running HERE runs, read by this
//     repo's engine like any member's declaration, and
//   - inside `packSeeds` on its `sheepdog` entry — what the fleet-pack-seed sweep
//     WRITES into every member (tasks/fleet-pack-seeds/check-fleet-pack-seeds.mjs).
//
// If the two disagree, the enforcer runs one configuration of a pack while every other
// repo under the owner runs another, and nothing anywhere compares them: the sweep
// writes the seed verbatim without consulting the enforcer's own entry, and a member
// has no way to know what the enforcer kept for itself.
//
// IT NAMES NO PACK, deliberately — the same design the sweep itself holds to
// ("THE ENFORCER NAMES NO PACK", fleet-config.mjs). The seeded ids are the whole
// vocabulary; for each one the enforcer ALSO declares, the two configs must agree. A
// pack the fleet standardizes on but this repo does not itself run is out of scope: an
// enforcer may hand out a pack it has no use for.
//
// AGREEMENT IS EXACT, because pack-agnostic is the point: nothing here may know that
// one pack's absent `path` means `preferences` while another's means something else.
// Two configs agree when they are the same value — which costs the enforcer nothing but
// writing a default out in both places, and buys a comparison that cannot be wrong
// about a pack it has never heard of.
//
// BLOCKING. The sweep SEEDS BUT NEVER OVERRIDES — "a member that already carries a
// config for it keeps that config" — so a wrong seed is written into each member
// exactly once and then sticks, and correcting it here un-writes nothing. The blast
// radius is every repo under the owner and the mistake is visible days later, in
// somebody else's repo.
