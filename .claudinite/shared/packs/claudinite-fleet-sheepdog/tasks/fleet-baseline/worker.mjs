// The fleet-baseline code-work entry point — the script the executor runs as
// `node worker.mjs` (cwd = this task dir, bounded by code_work_timeout) when a
// hand-created work item for this task is picked.
//
// It holds NO dispatch logic. The sweep is `force-fleet-baseline.mjs`, its SIBLING in
// this task folder — nothing outside this task uses it, so that is where it lives;
// this worker only resolves the parameters out of the item's Context and invokes it.
// Same shape as the other claudinite-fleet-sheepdog workers, deliberately.
//
// Parameters ride the item's Context (`CLAUDINITE_CONTEXT`, param-bag.mjs) and are
// handed to the sweep as the env names it reads — kept as env rather than arguments
// because the sweep predates this task and is still runnable by hand with the same
// envs.
//
// Failure is the escalation path: the sweep THROWS when a member could not be
// dispatched, this worker turns that into a non-zero exit, and the executor
// converges the item to `needs-human`.
