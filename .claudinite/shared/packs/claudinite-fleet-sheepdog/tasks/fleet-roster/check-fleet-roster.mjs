// The claudinite-fleet-sheepdog pack's fleet ROSTER sweep — one walk of the fleet answering the
// enforcer's two standing questions about every repo under the owner:
//
//   is this repo a MEMBER?           → `fleet-adoption` issues   (adoption-issues.mjs)
//   is that membership still MEANING anything?
//                                    → `fleet-drift` issues      (drift-issues.mjs)
//
// Run by this pack's `fleet-roster` scheduled task, whose worker calls `main()` below
// as the task's `code_work` — Action-side inside the enforcer repo's scheduler workflow,
// where the FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN the task declares in `code_work_required_secrets` is reachable as
// ordinary environment. Still runnable by hand (`node check-fleet-roster.mjs`) via the
// CLI guard at the foot.
//
// WHY ONE WALK (#788). The two questions were two tasks, and each carried its own
// enumeration, its own owner filter, its own empty-enumeration guard, its own
// home/canon/archived/fork/excluded skips and its own declaration read per repo. The
// freshness half's header claimed it "takes coverage as given" while in fact
// re-deriving it, on another cadence, in another process — so the two classifications
// could disagree and did: `exclude` was applied at different points (an excluded repo
// that still carried a declaration read `covered` to one and `out of scope` to the
// other), and each half's `unknown` failed its own run knowing nothing of the other's.
// The roster is now built ONCE and both halves consume it, so a repo has one
// membership verdict and the report has one failure boundary.
//
// WHAT IS STILL SEPARATE, deliberately: the two ISSUE FAMILIES. Coverage and drift
// close on unrelated conditions and carry unrelated remedies, so each keeps its own
// label, its own convergence policy and its own section of the report, in its own
// module. This file owns the walk and nothing else.
//
// UNKNOWN IS PER-QUESTION, which is the one behaviour the merge changes. A declaration
// that cannot be read or parsed is unknown to BOTH halves — it is the input they share.
// A mount probe that fails (the scheduler read, canon's compare) is unknown to the
// FRESHNESS half alone: the coverage half already read that repo's declaration
// successfully and keeps its verdict. Either kind of unknown fails the run, so nothing
// is downgraded to silence; what changes is that a compare outage no longer erases a
// repo from the coverage picture.
//
// Two rules kept from both predecessors:
//   - an indeterminate repo is UNKNOWN, never a finding — no issue is opened for it,
//     and the run fails so the cause escalates;
//   - an unreadable/absent claudinite-fleet-sheepdog config aborts the sweep — absence is not consent
//     to cover everything with no exclusions.
//
// Dependency-free (global fetch, Node 20+); read-only toward every repo except the
// enforcer, where it writes the two issue families and their labels.

// halves disagree about what some of those facts mean (an excluded repo is still
// `covered` to the coverage question and out of scope to the freshness one), and a
// single pre-chewed state would have to pick a winner. The views below do the
// interpreting, each for its own question.
//
// Reads per repo: the declaration, once — the read both halves needed and each used to
// make separately. Plus two more (scheduler workflow, canon compare) for the members
// the freshness half actually measures, and canon's version numbers, which the shared
// `canonVersions` reader fetches once per distinct pack across the whole walk.
