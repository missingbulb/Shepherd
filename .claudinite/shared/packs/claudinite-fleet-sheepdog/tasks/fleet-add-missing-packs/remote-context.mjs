// A repo context built over the REST API instead of a checkout — enough of one for a
// pack's `detect` fingerprint to run against a member the enforcer has not cloned.
//
// WHY it can only ever be an approximation. `buildContext` (engine/checks/helpers/
// repo-context.mjs) is backed by git and a real working tree, and `ctx.read` is
// SYNCHRONOUS. Over REST, a file's contents are a round trip. A fingerprint that only
// walks `ctx.tracked` (a package.json near the root, a workflow file, a tracked path)
// is therefore answerable from one cheap tree listing; a fingerprint that reads
// CONTENTS (a JWT library referenced in source, a manifest.json carrying
// "manifest_version") is not, until the files it wants have been fetched.
//
// So this resolves in two passes:
//
//   1. PROBE — run the fingerprint against a context whose `read` returns null and
//      RECORDS what was asked for. The verdict from this pass is discarded; the
//      recorded path list is the point.
//   2. RESOLVE — fetch those paths (at most `budget` of them), rebuild the context
//      with them warm, and run the fingerprint again. That answer is real.
//
// A fingerprint that asked for more files than the budget allows is reported
// UNDECIDED, never false: "we did not look" and "we looked and it isn't there" are
// different facts, and only one of them is safe to act on. A fingerprint that reads a
// handful of well-known paths (manifests, workflow files) resolves inside the budget;
// one that greps every source file in the repo does not, and the agent stage — which
// has the member checked out and can answer it exactly — is where it gets settled.
//
// The budget is per pack, per repo. It is a cost ceiling on a weekly sweep across
// every repo an owner has, not a correctness knob: raising it buys more resolved
// fingerprints and more API calls, and lowering it defers more to the agent.
