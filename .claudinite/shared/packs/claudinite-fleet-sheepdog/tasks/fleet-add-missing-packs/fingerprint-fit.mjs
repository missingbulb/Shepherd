// Which packs does this repo's shape suspect, that its declaration does not carry?
//
// A pack's `detect` fingerprint is consulted exactly once today — at bootstrap's
// `--init`, when the declaration is first written. Nothing re-asks afterwards, so a
// repo that grows into a pack months later (adds a package.json, a firebase.json, a
// JWT library) is never told the pack exists. This module is the re-ask, and it is
// deliberately the SELF-CONTAINED PER-REPO HALF: it answers the question for ONE
// context and knows nothing about any fleet, any owner, or any other repo.
//
// It is a SUSPICION, not a verdict. `pack-declaration` was deliberately retired as a
// conformance check (engine/checks/README.md) because whether to declare a pack is
// the project's call — a marker is a way to suspect a pack is wanted, never proof it
// must be. So nothing here returns a finding, blocks, or writes: it returns a list a
// caller may act on, and every caller so far turns it into something a human reviews.
//
// Still pack-agnostic by construction: it names no pack and reads no pack's
// internals beyond the manifest fields every pack has. `evaluate` is injected rather
// than calling `pack.detect(ctx)` here, because a caller that cannot serve file
// CONTENTS synchronously (a remote tree listing, say) must be able to answer "I could
// not decide this one" without that being mistaken for "no".

// already declared. A pack with `detect: null` is declaration-authoritative in BOTH

//   evaluate(pack) → true    the repo's shape matches — an undeclared FIT
//                  → false   it does not — silence, which is the common case
//                  → null    UNDECIDED: this caller could not serve what the
//                            fingerprint asked for (see the remote-context note in
//                            the claudinite-fleet-sheepdog fit sweep). Reported, never dropped.
//
// It may return `{ verdict, why }` instead, to say WHY it could not decide, and it
// may be async — a caller reading another repo over the network is the reason this
// function is awaited at all.
//
// A fingerprint that THROWS is undecided too, with the error text as the reason — a
// broken predicate must not be able to make a fleet look clean.
//

// render a full roster: every candidate lands under exactly one of the three states
// (fit, undecided, or the quiet majority that simply did not match).
