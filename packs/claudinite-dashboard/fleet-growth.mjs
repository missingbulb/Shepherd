// What the corpus is doing ACROSS the fleet, from the members' own usage files. Pure:
// no clock of its own beyond the one it is handed, no I/O, no DOM.
//
// This is the panel the fleet page could not have before. Every other figure it shows
// comes from a live read — issues, runs, a head commit — and none of those can answer
// the two questions a corpus is actually judged on: how much of it each session is
// paying for, and how often its checks caught something. Both live in each member's
// `usage.GENERATED.json`, which the page now reads anyway, so the panel costs nothing
// beyond what the sweep already spent.
//
// THE RULES THE FLEET PAGE'S OWN NUMBERS FOLLOW APPLY HERE TOO:
//
//   NO VANITY TOTAL. Every figure is a window against the window before it. A count
//   that only ever grows says nothing about this week.
//
//   NOTHING INVENTED. No estimate of hours saved, no score. Each figure is a sum of
//   things that individually happened and are individually checkable in a member's own
//   file.
//
//   AN UNREAD MEMBER IS NOT A ZERO. A member with no usage file is counted as NOT
//   FOLDING and named, never averaged in as a repo where nothing happens. That census
//   is the same fact the retired fleet aggregate carried as `coverage.absent`, derived
//   live instead of stored.

// benefits block above them, because they are read as a report card. The scope,
// rule, skill and member tables are the whole folded range (`days`, which is the
// file's own retention) with no comparison: a rule that fired twice this week and
// once last is not a trend, and "never loaded" is only a claim worth making over as
// long a range as the file holds. Each states the range it covers.
