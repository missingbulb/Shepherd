// READING A MEMBER'S SETTINGS FROM THE PAGE — one helper, because the page reads
// that file from three places (the repo view, the fleet view, the contributions
// panel). A repo that is not a member answers with nothing, which is what the
// caller reports as "does not run Claudinite".
//
// The name comes from the engine's browser-pure half: `settings-file.mjs` itself probes
// the disk, and a `node:` import anywhere in the page's graph blocks its first module
// load in the browser (#1286).
