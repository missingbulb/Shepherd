// defaulted: a task whose declaration this misreads must look unreadable, because a
// plausible wrong cadence would silently move a next-anchor the whole roster is
// read for. An ABSENT `preconditions` is not an unread one: a declaration that was
// read and carries no key requires nothing, exactly as its author wrote it, and

// contract's own door derives it.

// A declaration another repo still writes the retired `frequency` in carries no
