// What a window of token usage COST, and — just as often — what it cannot be said to
// have cost.
//
// The rates are a deployment's own fact, not the fold's: the same usage file priced by
// two different contracts gives two different answers, and the fold has no business
// guessing either. So they live in the deployment's config (`rates`, carried from this
// pack's declaration by `build-site.mjs`), and everything here is a reduction over the
// fold's `tokensByModel` rows against that table.
//
// THREE STATES, KEPT APART. A dollar figure here is one of:
//   - a number, when every model in the window has a rate;
//   - *unpriced*, when the deployment set no `rates` at all — a configuration gap,
//     which the page states by naming the key rather than showing $0;
//   - a number PLUS an unpriced remainder, when some models are rated and others are
//     not. The remainder travels as tokens, never folded into the sum, because a model
//     priced at nothing is the one error this whole module exists to avoid.
// A fourth state belongs to the fold, not here: a day whose rows carry no
// `tokensByModel` at all is *not recorded*, and `priceWindow` reports it as such.

// The config key the whole thing rests on, named once so the page's own "unpriced"
// note and this module cannot disagree about what a reader has to set.
