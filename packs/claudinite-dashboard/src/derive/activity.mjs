// The page's panels are all fault-finding, and fault-finding has a blind spot: after
// a good week every count is zero, so a healthy fleet and a dead one render
// identically. Nothing on the page can tell them apart, because "nothing is wrong" and
// "nothing happened" are the same picture. This module is the other reading — closed
// work, scheduler runs, and which members moved at all — over a window of days.
//
// EVERY NUMBER COMES FROM A READ THE PAGE ALREADY MAKES. A per-member call to get a
// commit count would undo the budget work the whole client is built around, so the
// inputs are exactly the fleet loader's existing per-member reads: the first page of
// issues, the recent Actions runs, and the head commit whose date arrives with the sha
// the content cache is keyed by. Nothing here adds a request.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS IS DEPTH, AND DEPTH IS DECLARED. One issue page is the most recent
// hundred issues by creation, and one runs page is the most recent thirty runs — so a
// day at the far end of the window is under-read rather than empty, and every series
// carries the horizon past which it stops being a count and starts being a floor.
