// PACK-CONTRIBUTED METRICS — the reader for what a pack says about a repo.
//
// A pack contributes DATA, NEVER CODE. Two JSON files, both lifted as text over the
// API exactly as task declarations are, because there is no `import` when reading
// another repo: a DESCRIPTOR shipped with the pack (`packs/<id>/dashboard.json`,
// found by path convention — nothing registers it) declaring what the pack has to
// say, and a VALUES file in the member's own tree
// (`.claudinite/local/dashboard/<pack>.GENERATED.json`) written by that pack's own
// machinery. The page executes nothing from either. The fleet view renders repos the
// viewer merely has read access to, so importing a member's modules would run twelve
// strangers' code in the viewer's browser with the viewer's token in scope.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: touch the DOM. It parses, validates, resolves a
// widget to its value and composes the PARTS of a phrase; `ui.mjs` renders them.
// That split is the whole reason a pack supplies values rather than a finished
// string — a string arrives flat, and the parts can be set in three registers.
//
// UNKNOWN IS NOT ZERO here as everywhere on this page. `undefined` means NOT READ (a
// withheld read, a failure); `null` means read and absent. They render differently
// and neither renders as a number.
